There are plenty of platforms that connect volunteers with opportunities, but potential volunteers might be reluctant to sign up for an event because they have no idea of what to expect. They donâ€™t know what the actual experience will be, and this is the problem we have addressed.

Volunteers Connect is a social platform built with React, Redux and Firebase where volunteers can interact with other volunteers, organizations and participants to share and document their experiences. 

Each event has a real time feed where volunteers, family members, organizations and participants can post text, images and videos. From this feed an event memory gallery is created so that potential volunteers can get a good picture of what each experience is like.

We have also implemented a direct messaging component so that volunteers can communicate with previous volunteers to get a better sense of the event. In addition, coordinators can also message volunteers about event information.
